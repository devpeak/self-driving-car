													****SELF-DRIVING-CAR*****

self driving car engineers uses two distinct approaches to autonomous development.

1. ROBOTICS APPROACH
2. DEEP LEARNING APPROACH

	1. ROBOTIC APPROACH fuses output from a suite of sensors to directly measure the vehicle surrounding and then navigate accordingly.

			~ self driving car engineers have been working on and perfecting the robotics approach for many years.

		More recently, Engineering teams have begun to use deep learning as a different approach for developing autonomous vehicles.

	2. DEEP LEARNING APPROACH allows self-driving cars to learn how to drive, by mimicking human driving behaviour.

Both, the robotics and deep learning methods, are actively being pursued today in the development of self-driving cars.
