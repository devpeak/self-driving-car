						  TERM 1
						PROJECT 1
				  ***FINDING LANE LINES***

WHY it is important ?

-> If one can't find the lane markings,Car would have no clue where to drive.
One may don't pay much attention to them, but as a self-driving car engineer,
it is the best friend. They tells a lot to where to drive.


						PROJECT 2
				  ***BEHAVIORAL CLONING***

Cloning means that our learning problem will copy and clone
human behaviour so does our steering actions and breaking gas acitons.
	
	When we train people,we dont't train them by giving them rules,	
	we train them by letting them learn form examples.
	Thus I am going to apply neural networks, deep learning to 
	camera images and do some of the very things
	a self-driving car ought to do right.


						PROJECT 3
			      ADVANCED LANE FINDING
				    AND VEHICLE DETECTION

what is compute vision, when you or i drive a car we use our eyes more than
any other organ to understand what to do.

COMPUTER VISION, this has the same capability into computers, uses cameras and
we learn how to extract things like #lane marking and other vehicles out of camera images.

		
						TERM 2
				SENSOR FUSION, LOCALZATION
						AND CONTROL

					PROJECT 4
				***SENSOR FUSION***

Science to intergrate different types of sensors. Self driving car have things 
like lidars and they radars and also cameras. And they have internal sensors called
gyroscopes inertial measurement units.

It is a science how to come up with single coherent picture based on these different modalities.


					PROJECT 5
				***LOCALIZATION***

Where, relative to the road is a car?

why it is important ? -  Because as we are going to see, we will have build maps 
of the environment.They have lots of detailed information. Some of which might even 
be invisible to the robot like, where are the danger zones, where do pedestrains 
typically cross. And to make sense of those maps, the world must know where is right
for the map. And, the alignment of the sensor data the current position to a map, 
that's what is called localization.


					PROJECT 6
				***CONTROLLERS***

-> A computer programs that steers your wheels, your gas pedal, so as to meet a given objective.
 
So for example, if the objective is to stay centered in the road, and you start driving and
your car veersto the left. Controller is the unit that decides the decision(okay).We compensate
with a slight right turn of the steering wheel. That might sound trivial but it's really easy to screw it up.


							TERM 3
				*** PATH PLANNING & CONTROLLING 
						A REAL SELF-DRIVING CAR! ***

					PROJECT 7
				***PATH PLANNING***

Science of how to find a valid sequence of steps or actions in a maze.
A sequence of streets you want to go down to make it all the way to the end.
A Path Planning Algorithm is an algortihm that finds that sequence of acitons for you.
We will apply it to city navigation and parking navigation , eg for crossing a parking lot.

				***CODE IN PHYSICAL CAR***
